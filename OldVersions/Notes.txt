Notes

Scope of project:
Not something totally new, but adjacent
E.g. play around with boundary conditions / parameters in existing examples

3 body problem, using a GPU:
Curriculumn learning setting end of subinterval as new ICs
KP will ask about it

Parameter inference

Investigate complexity? Asymptotic complexity or actual:
See what PyTorch can tell you w.r.t. memory and work
Otherwise go for asymptotic complexity and investigate this changes
as parts of the problem change (e.g. with new BCs, longer time interval)

Investigate "shooting" methods

Solution bundles, complexity and parameter inference would be A LOT 



Poster:
Need to explain ML basics but only those strictly required 

Presentation:
Maybe coordinate with others to explain different parts
But not strictly required, so make own presentation self-contained
